## Description

In Bedrock buried treasure always generates at block position of x8,z8 within the chunk. Where x0,z0 is the NW corner of the chunk and x15,z15 is SE corner of the chunk. This feature will highlight the block position x8,z8 within the chunk, showing you where to dig for buried treasure.

## Taken from

[Bedrock Technical Resource Pack](https://github.com/RavinMaddHatter/Bedrock-Technical-Resource-Pack)

This strips out the feature into a standalone addon and updates it to support 1.19.30

## How To Use

To use this feature, get within the chunk that contains the buried treasure. This is simple, just use the treasure map until your character marker is directly over the buried treasure marker. 

Place down the armor stand and equip the armor stand with a **filled map**. Because the armor stand calculates from the NW corner of it's current chunk, you don't need to worry about facing direction. The armor stand will always highlight block block position x8,z8 within the chunk.
